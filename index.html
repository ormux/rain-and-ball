         <p>In April 13, 2016 I began to learn coding through <a href="www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> by taking the course <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</a></p>
         <p>These are my original coding projects when I was 16 years old, it is a simple animation that goes on forever.
         And unlike traditional coding journeys I didn't start with the infamous "hello world" I started with animation.
         These two are dear to me because it inspired me to create much more complex animations and simple web games.
         I almost thought I lost these two projects because Khan Academy already cleared by projects history.
         Luckily I had them saved locally somewhere in my computer and it took me 1 hour to figure out how run them properly.</p>

         <p>The backbone of Khan Academy's animation editor is the original <a href="http://processingjs.org/">ProcessingJS</a> library which is now obsolete.
         I recalled <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> as one of the few "processing engines" so I tried running it with that. But it failed so I search and found this <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/advanced-development-tools/a/using-processingjs-outside-khan-academy">article</a>.
         Surely enough this worked but I had to organise it a bit so it is not messy to look at so I made this page just so I can showcase these two animations of mine.</p>
